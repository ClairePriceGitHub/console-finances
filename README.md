# Console Finances

## Description

Project to create code which will analyse the financial records of a company, after being provided with a financial dataset. Creating this code enables useful information for a business to be easily extracted.
This project developed fundamental JavaScript knowledge requiring research and testing of code.
On completion of this project I became comfortable with handling a financial dataset and extracting and manipulating useful information, and I also understand the usefulness of using code for these purposes
